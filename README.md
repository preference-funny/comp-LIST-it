## üéØ Overview

Comprehensive DNS blocklists for **corporate boycotts**. This repository provides curated lists of company-specific domains in multiple formats for use with various DNS filtering solutions like Pi-hole, AdGuard, and others. Block specific corporations while avoiding generic third-party services that could break other websites.

### üè¢ Currently Available Companies
- **üè∞ Disney** - Complete Disney ecosystem including streaming, networks, and subsidiaries
- **üì∫ Sinclair Broadcasting** - TV stations, Tennis Channel, and multicast networks

### üîë Key Features

- **Company-Specific**: Only includes domains owned or controlled by target corporations
- **Multiple Formats**: Compatible with Pi-hole, AdGuard, hosts files, DNSMasq, and more
- **Property-Specific Lists**: Individual lists for streaming services, networks, subsidiaries, etc.
- **Conservative Approach**: Excludes generic third-party services to avoid breaking other content
- **Regular Updates**: Maintained and updated as companies expand their digital properties

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

These blocklists **only include company-owned domains** and avoid generic third-party services (like Google Analytics, Facebook, Amazon ads, etc.) that companies use but other websites also depend on. This conservative approach ensures you're blocking specific company content without inadvertently breaking other services.
