Disney Block List (comp-LIST-it)
A comprehensive DNS blocklist for Disney-owned properties and services.

This repository contains domain lists specifically targeting The Walt Disney Company
and its subsidiaries. The lists are designed to block Disney-specific content while
avoiding generic third-party services to prevent breaking non-Disney websites.
